  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, working under the supervision of 
    <a href="#">Prof. Amanda Prorok</a> in the Prorok Lab. My research is at the forefront of multi-agent systems, 
    with a particular focus on developing intelligent coordination strategies for heterogeneous robot teams.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Prior to my PhD, I completed my Master's degree in Engineering with a specialization in optimization 
    and network design. This background in mathematical optimization has strongly influenced my approach 
    to multi-agent problems, leading me to develop principled solutions that balance theoretical rigor 
    with practical applicability.
  </p>

  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <p>
    My research sits at the intersection of several exciting areas in AI and robotics:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems:</strong> Developing algorithms that enable diverse agents with different capabilities to work together effectively</li>
    <li><strong>Graph Neural Networks:</strong> Leveraging the power of graph-based representations for multi-agent communication and coordination</li>
    <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Creating novel RL algorithms tailored for multi-agent scenarios</li>
    <li><strong>Robotics Applications:</strong> Applying theoretical advances to real-world robotic systems</li>
    <li><strong>Simulation and Benchmarking:</strong> Building tools that accelerate research in multi-agent systems</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    I believe that the future of AI lies in systems that can collaborate, adapt, and learn from each other. 
    My work is driven by the vision of creating intelligent agent teams that can tackle complex real-world 
    challenges, from autonomous vehicle coordination to swarm robotics and beyond.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I'm passionate about open science and reproducible research. This is why I actively contribute to 
    open-source projects and strive to make my research accessible through well-documented code, 
    comprehensive datasets, and clear publications.
  </p>

  <h2>Current Focus</h2>
  <p>
    At Meta AI, I'm working on cutting-edge projects involving Large Language Model (LLM) agents for 
    long-horizon tasks. This role allows me to bridge academic research with industrial applications, 
    exploring how advanced AI systems can be deployed at scale.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My PhD research continues to focus on the fundamental challenges of multi-agent coordination, 
    with recent work exploring how Graph Neural Networks can enable more effective communication 
    and learning in heterogeneous agent teams.
  </p>

  <h2>Beyond Research</h2>
  <p>
    When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>🎸 Playing guitar and exploring music production</li>
    <li>📚 Reading about emerging technologies and their societal implications</li>
    <li>🌱 Contributing to environmental sustainability initiatives</li>
    <li>🏃‍♂️ Running and outdoor activities</li>
    <li>👥 Mentoring junior researchers and students</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    I'm always excited to discuss research ideas, potential collaborations, or just chat about 
    the latest developments in AI and robotics. Feel free to reach out!
