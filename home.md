<div class="content-section">
  <h1 class="greeting">Welcome! 👋</h1>
  
  <p class="intro">
    I'm Antonio Marino, a passionate AI researcher working at the intersection of 
    multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning.
  </p>
  
  <div class="description">
    <p>
      Currently pursuing my PhD at the <strong>University of Cambridge</strong> and working as an AI Researcher at <strong>Meta AI</strong>. 
      My research focuses on developing novel algorithms for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, 
      with applications in robotics and autonomous systems.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I'm particularly interested in:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>🤖 <strong>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Developing coordination strategies for diverse agent teams</li>
      <li>🧠 <strong>Graph Neural Networks</strong> - Leveraging graph structures for agent communication and learning</li>
      <li>🔬 <strong>Simulation Environments</strong> - Building high-performance tools for multi-agent research</li>
      <li>🚀 <strong>Real-world Applications</strong> - Bridging the gap between research and practical robotics</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      My work has been published in top-tier venues including ICML, IROS, and NeurIPS workshops. 
      I'm also a core contributor to several open-source projects in the PyTorch ecosystem, 
      including <a href="https://github.com/proroklab/VectorizedMultiAgentSimulator">VMAS</a> 
      and <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/rl">BenchMARL</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When I'm not coding or researching, you can find me exploring new technologies, 
      contributing to the open-source community, or sharing knowledge through talks and tutorials.
    </p>
