  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    I am a postoc researcher in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, working under the supervision of 
    <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/asp45">Prof. Amanda Prorok</a> in the Prorok Lab. My research is at the farefront of multi-robot system, with a particular focus on developing intelligent coordination and distributed control strategies for heterogeneous robot teams.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Prior to my current position, I completed my doctoral degree in hybrid learning-control approaches for multi-robot systems and communication-based systems. The strong background in automatic control and intelligent systems has strongly influenced my approach to multi-agent problems, leading me to develop principled solutions that balance theoretical rigor 
    with practical applicability.
  </p>

  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>
  My research sits at the intersection of robotics, control theory, and machine learning, bridging the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world applicability. My primary focus areas include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hybrid Learning & Control:</strong> Reconciling classical control techniques (Lyapunov, Contraction Theory) with modern deep learning to ensure stability and safety in neural policies.</li>
  <li><strong>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems:</strong> Investigating "functional heterogeneity" to understand how diverse agents (varying in morphology, resources, or roles) can optimize complex tasks better than homogeneous swarms.</li>
  <li><strong>Graph Neural Networks & Dynamics:</strong> Developing "Liquid-Graph Time-Constant Networks" and analyzing GNNs as distributed dynamical systems to ensure Input-to-State Stability (ISS) in communication graphs.</li>
  <li><strong>Environment-Policy Co-Design:</strong> Moving beyond adaptation to active reshaping, where robot teams jointly optimize their control policies and the topology of the environment they inhabit.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-Scale Robotics:</strong> Validating algorithms across radically different scales, from autonomous aerial swarms navigating cluttered spaces to magnetically driven micro-robots for medical applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>
  I believe the next generation of multi-robot systems must shift from "seeing" to "doing"—moving beyond passive observation to active physical intervention and manipulation. 
  While end-to-end learning offers computational advantages, I argue that deploying "black box" models on physical systems introduces unacceptable risks. 
</p>

<p>
  My research philosophy advocates for a <strong>hybrid approach</strong>: conditioning learned policies with provable control structures. By using first-order principles to inherently achieve safety and robustness, we can treat these constraints as design features rather than afterthoughts.
  I am committed to bridging the simulation-to-reality gap, ensuring that theoretical advances in decentralized coordination—such as dynamic cluster agreements—are rigorously validated on physical platforms.
</p>

<h2>Current Focus</h2>
<p>
  Currently, as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Cambridge, my work is structured around three main thrusts:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Functional Heterogeneity & Dynamic Coalitions:</strong> Formalizing a "holistic diversity metric" to guide the coordination of teams with diverse morphologies and roles. I am developing frameworks where agents dynamically self-cluster into strategic coalitions to address conflicting multi-objective trade-offs, quantifying the advantage of diversity through a "Price of Homogeneity" analysis.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dynamic Environment Co-Design:</strong> Developing frameworks where robots act as a reconfigurable medium, capable of assembling and disassembling to reshape their surroundings for optimal task execution.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Physical Manipulation & Interaction:</strong> Addressing the challenges of "wild," unstructured environments by enabling heterogeneous teams to manipulate complex objects, including deformable linear objects like cables and nets, under uncertainty.
  </li>
</ul>

  <h2>Beyond Research</h2>
  <p>
    When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li> 🎸 Playing guitar and exploring music production.</li>
    <li>📚 Reading about emerging technologies.</li>
    <li>❤️ Spend time with my beautiful wife.</li>
  </ul>
